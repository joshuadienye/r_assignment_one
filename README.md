# R Assignment One
The first assignment in my R course. The questions are as follows:

# Chapter 3.4 
2. Create your own script header. Make sure you include all information about yourself so that it serves as a business card as well. Make sure it doesn’t execute with the other R code using the “comment” option.

3. Find the best library to build a neural network (type: perceptron).
a) Install the library,
b) Read the library documentation from CRAN,
c) Get the R help document for the function that trains the model (hint: fist, find the function from the library document, secondly, use the “?” option to get help on the function)

# Chapter 4.4
10.Create a user defined function that can clean up almost any data frame using a loop. The function inputs are the dataset name and the column indexes that we want to clean up. 

The loop inside the function will take column indexes (from the call inputs) and remove observations with empty values.

Test your function with any dataset found on the www.images.aqr.com/Insights/Datasets website.
